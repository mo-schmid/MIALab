\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  \graphicspath{{../img/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
   \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
\usepackage{changepage}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
\usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix

%\usepackage[ngerman]{babel}



%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

% to submit to, of course. )

\IEEEPARstart{P}{rogression} of neurodegenerative diseases can be tracked by the atrophy of brain tissues.
Manual segmentation and measurement is very time consuming and thus is not a viable option in clinical practice. 
The goal of the pipeline described in this paper is the segmentation of grey matter, white matter, hippocampus, amygdala and thalamus. 
Grey matter mostly consists of neuronal cell bodies, which are unmyelinated. White matter consists mostly of myelinated axons. These myelinated axons are connected to the grey matter areas. In the hippocampus occurs learning and memory. The amygdala is responsible for our emotions and aggression, and the thalamus is the relay centre for sensory information. To segment these parts correctly, i.e. know their position and volume accurately, is an important step during neurosurgical planning and simulation, which may lead to less complication and higher success rate during the surgery. 
In this paper we investigate the hypothesis whether spatial regularization improves the segmentation of the given segmentation pipeline. Therefore we have examined two different postprocessing approaches. Probabilistic keyhole filling to remove small isolated regions is a simple heuristic approach which is invented by us. In recent studies, postprocessing algorithm as conditional random field (CRF) achieved promising results. In a one of these studies fully connected CRF Model was used to postprocess segmented images of cities and landscape images \cite{Liu2018}. Other recent studies show the use of an efficient multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network to improve the segmentation \cite{Kamnitsas2017}. Hence, we propose improved segmentation of the parts described using a conditional random field algorithm as a second approach.
The chapter Material and Methods gives a quick overview of the whole pipeline. Our main focus is described in the sub-chapter postprocessing including its processes and procedures. The result section is divided by showing our accomplishments in each approach (PKF and CRF). These advantages and disadvantages, as well as our suggested procedure is described in the discussion/conclusion.

\section{Materials and Methods}
\subsection{Data}
The data used for the training of the model is from 30 unrelated healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Project data set. The data set contains images of a three Tesla MRI T1 and T2-weighted with segmentation as ground truth. The data set is defaced in order to make it  completely anonymous.
\subsection{Methods}
\begin{figure}[h!]

\caption{Schematic representation of the image processing pipeline.}
\label{fig_pipeline}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Registration}

Alignment of the images to a common reference space named atlas.

\subsubsection{Preprocessing}

Improvement of the image quality for the subsequent classification.

\subsubsection{Feature Extraction}

Finding representing features for brain tissues.

\subsubsection{Classification}

Predicts to which label or class a voxel belongs.

\subsubsection{Postprocessing}

The predicted masks with the segmentation have some obvious mistakes, e.g. keyholes, misclassified voxels and rough borders. Our approach to solving this issue is by using probabilistic keyhole filling and dense conditional random field algorithm. 
\newline
\textbf{Approach I: Probabilistic Keyhole Filling (PKF)}
\newline
In this section we explain the basic concept and the procedure of the PKF. The Goal of the PFK is to incorporate prior knowledge into the postprocessing. We know that we are segmenting connected structures within the brain, therefore the obtained labels also have to be connected. The structures to be segmented are also uniform in themselves.
This means that within the local neighbourhood (26-connected) of one voxel, all voxels should carry the same label (unless it is a boundary voxel).
To achieve this, in a first step, the probability images of the labels produced by the random forest algorithm are smoothed with a Gaussian filter. Subsequently, a new segmentation mask is created by assigning the label with the highest probability to a voxel. In the original segmentation mask generated by the pipeline, only those labels are assumed to be fixed which belong to the largest component of the respective label. All labels that are not fixed are then corrected using the newly generated segmentation mask. To better preserve areas that obviously belong to the background, there is the option to treat the background as an explicit label. The described algorithm thus has the variance of the Gaussian smoothing and the option "preserve background" as parameters.
\newline
\textbf{Approach II: Dense Conditional Random Field (DCRF)}
\newline
The DCRF model was first published by Philipp Krahenbühl and Vladlen Koltun in NIPS 2011 \cite{Krahenbuhl2012}. In Krähenbühl’s and Koltun’s paper, the exact derivation of the model can be seen. For this paper, the parameter appearance kernel and smoothness kernel were adjusted to achieve the best results . The appearance kernel takes nearby pixels with similar colours into account, which are most probable in the same segmentation label. The smoothness kernel removes small keyholes. The following equation \ref{eq:1} shows the influence of the adjustable parameter and weights of the two-kernel potentials:
\begin{multline}\label{eq:1}
    k\left(f_i,f_j\right)=\\
\omega^{\left(1\right)}  exp\left(-\frac{\left| p_i - p_j\right|^2}{2\theta^2_\alpha}-\frac{\left| I_i-I_j\right|^2}{2\theta^2_\beta}\right)\\
+\omega^{\left(2\right)}exp\left(-\frac{\left|p_i-p_j\right|^2}{2\theta^2_\gamma}\right)
\end{multline}

$\theta_\alpha$, $\theta_\beta$ for the appearance kernel and $\theta_\gamma$ for the smoothness kernel are the weights of the equation and were optimised using a grid search method. The higher these weights are, the less influence this kernel has in the DCRF model.
\subsubsection{Data Analysis}
The results are evaluated on whether the improvements are statistically significant (significance level $\alpha = 5\%$). Because the change of the metrics before and after the postprocessing is compared, the data is considered to be paired. Therefore, the tests are performed on the differences of the metrics before and after the postprocessing of a data set. Depending on the distribution of the obtained data a different statistical test is used. A paired two-sided t-test is used if the distribution is approximately normal and a sign test otherwise. The distribution is evaluated graphically using QQ-plots. The data is considered approximately normal distributed if all data points lie within the $95\%$ confidence bounds. The corresponding QQ-Plots can be found in Appendix \ref{sec_qq} QQ-Plot. For our data we used the paired two-sided t-test to evaluate the difference in the Dice coefficient and the sign test to evaluate the the difference in the Hausdorff distance.

In figure \ref{fig_pkf_dice} all labels show a statistical significant improvement with postprocessing using the parameter variance equal to 20 and including preservation of background. The values of the Dice indices can be seen in table \ref{tbl_pkf_dice} and the values of the Hausdorff distances are in table \ref{tbl_pkf_hd}.
In figure \ref{fig_pkf-hd} and table \ref{tbl_pkf_hd} the label containing grey matter shows no significant improvement. All other labels show a significant improvement, especially for the label containing thalamus the Hausdorff distance is reduced by almost a factor of three.
In figure \ref{fig_pkf} the visual improvement of the postprocessing can be seen. The red circle highlights the area where the miss labeled segmentation is corrected. Additionally the figure demonstrates that with the PKF method the overall uniformity of the segments is increased and less holes (Background) or miss labeled voxels can be found.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig_dcrf_dice} shows that all difference are statistically significant. However, the label white matter and grey matter are significantly worse than without postprocessing.
The values of the Dice indices can be seen in table \ref{tbl_dcrf_dice} and the values of the Hausdorff distances are in table \ref{tbl_dcrf_hd}.
Comparing the results using the Hausdorff distance shown in figure \ref{fig_dcrf-hd} and table \ref{tbl_dcrf_hd} the label grey matter is again worse than without postprocessing. All other labels however show a significant improvement compared to no postprocessing. 
Figure \ref{fig_dcrf} shows the graphical difference of DCRF compared to the ground truth and no postprocessing. The improvement of the label thalamus comes clearly forward, since again the red parts to the left and right of the thalamus regions are removed. These removed parts including some keyhole background regions are filled with the green label of white matter. 
The boundaries of the grey matter are blown up, i.e. GM is less sparse in the postprocessing image using DCRF compared to the ground truth and the image without postprocessing.


\section{Discussion}
The figures on which the comparison of the Hausdorff distance are plotted, show the most significant difference. The PKF method shows a significant improvement compared to the images without postprocessing. The second method implemented shows an even higher significant improvement. This additional improvement was expected, because the DCRF method contains a PKF method using a Gaussian approximation. In the graphical comparisons figures \ref{fig_pkf} and \ref{fig_dcrf}, the impact of the appearance kernel can be seen in comparison to only the keyhole filling method. The edges of the DCRF method appear to be more enlarged compared to the edges of the PKF method.
Although the most differences between no postprocessing and postprocessing are significant their impact on the overall segmentation is questionable. For the PKF and the DCRF the largest changes in the metric was in both cases made in the Hausdorff distance. There we can see an improvement for the labels of the smaller brain regions (hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus). This Change can also be seen in the visual interpretation of the postprocessing, where the mislabeled regions of the Red segmentation (thalamus) are corrected. The small changes in the dice indices could be explained by the fact, that both Methods do not alter the overall area of an label on a large extent. Thus correcting the labels of only a few voxels has almost no effect on the dice indices.
\section{Conclusion}
Our second postprocessing method resulted in significantly better results in comparison to our other approaches measured in Dice indices and Hausdorff distances. However, the computational effort using DCRF is significantly higher in comparison to the probabilistic keyhole filling method. A disadvantage of the probabilistic keyhole filling, which is clearly visible in figure \ref{fig_pkf}, is the rough edges. This is a clear advantage of the DCRF. To improve the probabilistic keyhole filling, a smaller variance value could be defined in order to not just fill the keyholes but also fill small gaps on the edges. This could result in a sufficient compromise between quality and speed of the segmentation.
